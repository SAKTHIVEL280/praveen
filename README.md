## Deployment

Deploy the `dist/` output produced by:

```bash
npm run build
```

Primary production domain:

- `https://sakthivel.daeq.in`

This project is configured for Vercel hosting via `vercel.json`, including:

- cache headers for versioned asset files
- basic hardening headers for browser security

It can also be deployed on Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or any static hosting platform with equivalent SPA rewrite rules.
